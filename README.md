Developer page: Dev Branch

## Notes for Development
Development page is being worked out on the 'Dev' branch.
The page is using a simple html, CSS, JS stack with Bootstrap.
Use [Brackets IDE](http://brackets.io/). It will auto refresh page on html/css/js changes!


### Suggestions for later development
We could implement Webpack, allowing us to use SCSS, ES6, and/or React.
